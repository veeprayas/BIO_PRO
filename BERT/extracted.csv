"a recent systematic analysis showed that in 2011  314  296  331  million children younger than 5 years were mildly  moderately or severely stunted and 258  240  274  million were mildly  moderately or severely underweight in the developing countries  
the same as this study in other studies have also emphasized that there must be efforts to strengthen the capacity within the schools to deal with the nutritional problems either overweight  obesity or malnutrition by using of educational and nutritional intervention"," background : the present study was carried out to assess the effects of community nutrition intervention based on advocacy approach on malnutrition status among school - aged children in shiraz , iran.materials and methods : this case - control nutritional intervention has been done between 2008 and 2009 on 2897 primary and secondary school boys and girls ( 7 - 13 years old ) based on advocacy approach in shiraz , iran . 
 the project provided nutritious snacks in public schools over a 2-year period along with advocacy oriented actions in order to implement and promote nutritional intervention . for evaluation of effectiveness of the intervention growth monitoring indices of pre- and post - intervention were statistically compared.results:the frequency of subjects with body mass index lower than 5% decreased significantly after intervention among girls ( p = 0.02 ) . 
 however , there were no significant changes among boys or total population . 
 the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys as well as in total population . 
 the pre- and post - test education assessment in both groups showed that the student 's average knowledge score has been significantly increased from 12.5  3.2 to 16.8  4.3 ( p < 0.0001).conclusion : this study demonstrates the potential success and scalability of school feeding programs in iran . 
 community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children . "
it occurs in more than 50 of patients and may reach 90 in certain types of cancers  especially in patients undergoing chemotherapy andor radiation therapy 26 anemia of chronic disease may occur in patients with cancer and is associated with an increase in hepcidin levels  which decreases oral iron absorption and bone marrow iron use  negating any possible effect of regular doses of oral iron," backgroundanemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing active therapy is commonly encountered and may worsen quality of life in these patients . the effect of blood transfusion is often temporary and may be associated with serious adverse events . 
 erythropoiesis - stimulating agents are not effective in 30%50% of patients and may have a negative effect on overall survival.aimsto assess the efficacy and feasibility of intravenous iron therapy in patients with cancer who have non - iron - deficiency anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy without the use of erythropoiesis - stimulating agents.methodsadult patients with solid cancers and non - iron - deficiency anemia were included . 
 ferric sucrose at a dose of 200 mg was given in short intravenous infusions weekly for a total of 12 weeks . 
 hemoglobin level was measured at baseline , every 3 weeks , and 2 weeks after the last iron infusion ( week 14 ) . 
 adverse events related to intravenous iron were prospectively reported.resultsof 25 patients included , 19 ( 76.0% ) completed at least three iron infusions and 14 ( 56.0% ) finished the planned 12 weeks of therapy . 
 the mean hemoglobin level of the 25 patients at baseline was 9.6 g / dl ( median , 9.9 g / dl ; range , 6.9 g / dl 10.9 g / dl ) . the mean change in hemoglobin level for the 15 patients who completed at least 9 treatments was 1.7 g / dl ( median , 1.1 g / dl ; range , 1.9 g / dl to 3.2 g / dl ) ; it reached 2.1 g / dl ( median , 1.3 g / dl ; range , 0.2 g / dl to 4.6 g / dl ; p = 0.0007 ) for the 14 patients who completed all 12 weekly treatments . 
 five ( 20.0% ) patients were transfused and considered as treatment failures . 
 no treatment - related adverse events were reported.conclusionintravenous iron treatment alone is safe and may reduce blood transfusion requirements and improve hemoglobin level in patients with cancer who are undergoing anticancer therapy . 
 further randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings . "
tardive dystonia  td   a rarer side effect after longer exposure to antipsychotics  is characterized by local or general  sustained  involuntary contraction of a muscle or muscle group  with twisting movements  generally slow  which may affect the limbs  trunk  neck  or face   even though a number of studies suggest that bipolar patients experience higher rates of eps  parkinsonism  dystonia  akathisia  and td compared to patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia  research within the bd population has been limited," tardive dystonia ( td ) is a serious side effect of antipsychotic medications , more with typical antipsychotics , that is potentially irreversible in affected patients . 
 studies show that newer atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of td . as a result , many clinicians may have developed a false sense of security when prescribing these medications . 
 we report a case of 20-year - old male with hyperthymic temperament and borderline intellectual functioning , who developed severe td after low dose short duration exposure to atypical antipsychotic risperidone and then olanzapine . 
 the goal of this paper is to alert the reader to be judicious and cautious before using casual low dose second generation antipsychotics in patient with no core psychotic features , hyperthymic temperament , or borderline intellectual functioning suggestive of organic brain damage , who are more prone to develop adverse effects such as td and monitor the onset of td in patients taking atypical antipsychotics .

"lepidoptera include agricultural pests that  through feeding and other activities  negatively affect stored grains  food and fiber crops  2  3    melanogaster the imd pathway also contributes to amp gene induction and is triggered by direct interaction of dap  pgn  a mamp typical of gram  negative bacteria  with the transmembrane receptor pgrp  lc  82  83  125  126   
the translocation of relish into the nucleus is regulated by two recently discovered components of this pathway  inhibitor of apoptosis 2  iap2  and transforming growth factor  activated kinase 1  tak1binding protein 2  tab2   132  133"," many lepidopteran insects are agricultural pests that affect stored grains , food and fiber crops . 
 these insects have negative ecological and economic impacts since they lower crop yield , and pesticides are expensive and can have off - target effects on beneficial arthropods 
 . a better understanding of lepidopteran immunity will aid in identifying new targets for the development of specific insect pest management compounds . 
 a fundamental aspect of immunity , and therefore a logical target for control , is the induction of antimicrobial peptide ( amp ) expression . 
 these peptides insert into and disrupt microbial membranes , thereby promoting pathogen clearance and insect survival . 
 pathways leading to amp expression have been extensively studied in the dipteran drosophila melanogaster . however , diptera are an important group of pollinators and pest management strategies that target their immune systems is not recommended . 
 recent advances have facilitated investigation of lepidopteran immunity , revealing both conserved and derived characteristics . 
 although the general pathways leading to amp expression are conserved , specific components of these pathways , such as recognition proteins have diverged . in this review 
 we highlight how such comparative immunology could aid in developing pest management strategies that are specific to agricultural insect pests . "
"syncope is caused by transient diffuse cerebral hypoperfusion and is characterized by transient loss of consciousness with a rapid onset followed by spontaneous and complete recovery  
this case highlights the fact that cough syncope  a rare form of syncope  may be associated with intracranial mass lesions that indirectly exaggerate the increase in icp in response to cough"," we present an unusual case of recurrent cough syncope in a 43-year - old woman , which was initially thought to be seizures . 
 syncopal episodes were triggered by paroxysms of cough and were characterized by unresponsiveness and myoclonic jerks in her extremities . 
 she had a left - sided glomus jugulare tumor that extended into the posterior cranial fossa with evidence of worsening communicating hydrocephalus on brain imaging . 
 we postulate that bouts of cough produced increased intracranial pressure both by raising intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures as well as by transient obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow secondary to intermittent tonsillar herniation during cough . 
 this resulted in diffuse decrease in cerebral blood flow causing syncope . 
 the patient 's syncopal episodes decreased in frequency once an external ventricular drain was placed followed by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt . 
 search for factors that can increase intracranial pressure seems warranted in patients with recurrent cough syncope . "
"world  wide  infertility affects 1015 of couples who are trying to conceive  and about 15 of these cases are caused by male factors  which affect 1 out of 20 men in the general population  
however  it was not understood how mir210  which is one of the up  regulated mirnas in testes of patients with noa  was involved in spermatogenesis in male infertility"," backgroundmicrornas ( mirnas ) play pivotal roles in spermatogenesis . 
 microrna-210 ( mir-210 ) expression was up - regulated in the testes of sterile men with non - obstructive azoospermia ( noa ) . 
 however , the underlying mechanisms of mir-210 involved in the spermatogenesis in patients with noa are unknown.material/methodsexpression of mir-210 and insulin - like growth factor ii ( igf2 ) in the testes of noa cases ( only including maturation arrest and hypospermatogenesis ) were detected in this study . 
 we carried out in vitro experiments to determine if igf2 was directly targeted by mir-210 in nt2 cells.resultscompared with obstructive azoospermia ( oa ) as normal control , our results suggest that mir-210 was significantly up - regulated in testis of patients with noa ( p<0.05 ) , and igf2 was down - regulated , but without a significant difference .

midwife  led primary delivery care for  low  risk  pregnant women during labor has been reported to have various advantages  such as increased odds of high maternal satisfaction and a decrease of unnecessary medical interventions  18    to date  we have found no evidence that midwife  led primary obstetric care is unsafe for  low  risk  pregnant women in comparison with obstetric care with the favorable cooperation of obstetricians and midwives in japan  912," 
 objective . 
 the objective of this study was to describe the recent clinical characteristics of labor using 3 systems of japanese midwife - led primary delivery care , as follows : ( 1 ) those intending to give birth at home managed by midwives who do not belong to our hospital , ( 2 ) those planning to give birth in our hospital managed by the same midwives , and ( 3 ) those planning to give birth managed by midwives who belong to our hospital . 
 methods . a retrospective cohort study was performed . 
 results . 
 there were no significant differences in the obstetric or neonatal outcomes among the 3 groups . 
 the rate of transfers during labor with the system involving midwives belonging to our hospital was higher than those with the other 2 systems . 
 in addition , the timing of transfers in the system with the midwives belonging to our hospital was earlier than with the other 2 systems . among the 3 groups , 
 there were no significant differences in the rate of the main 2 indications for transfers : fetal heart rate abnormality and failure to progress . conclusion . 
 there were no significant differences in perinatal outcomes among the 3 systems ; however , there were some differences in the status of transfers to obstetric shared care . "

however  in the danish population  there were no differences in the distribution of frequencies of dominant types  kk wild type and kq  qq variant type  and alleles  19"," type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance , and enpp1 plays an important role in insulin resistance . 
 we investigated the association of the enpp1 k121q polymorphism with both diabetes and obesity ( body mass index [ bmi ] ) in korean male workers . 
 the study design was case - control . 
 subjects were 1,945 male workers ( type 2 diabetes , 195 ; non - diabetes , 1,750 ) of nuclear power plants who received examinations from march to october in 2004 . 
 we collected venous blood samples under fasting ( 8 hr ) conditions , calculated bmi by height and weight , and assessed relevant biochemical factors . 
 the results of this study demonstrated that the enpp1 121q genotype ( kq+qq types ) was not associated with type 2 diabetes ( odds ratios [ or ] , 0.854 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 0.571 - 1.278 ) or obesity ( or , 0.933 ; 95% ci , 0.731 - 1.190 ) .

 we concluded that the enpp1 121q allele is not a critical determinant for either diabetes or obesity in korean males . 
 the discordance between the results of this study and those derived from studies of dominican , south asian , caucasian , finnish , and french populations might be due to differences in genetic backgrounds between these populations . "
"lipid apheresis provides a safe and effective means of treating patients with severe hyperlipidemia   the ldl  apheresis atherosclerosis regression study  laars 
looked at the change in plaque characteristics of patients undergoing apheresis compared to drug therapy over a period of two years"," lipid apheresis is used to treat patients with severe hyperlipidemia by reducing low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) . 
 this study examines the effect of apheresis on the lipid panel and cardiac event rates before and after apheresis . 
 an electronic health record screen of ambulatory patients identified 11 active patients undergoing lipid apheresis with 10/11 carrying a diagnosis of fh . 
 baseline demographics , pre- and postapheresis lipid levels , highest recorded ldl - c , cardiac events , current medications , and first apheresis treatment were recorded . 
 patients completed a questionnaire and self - reported risk factors and interest in alternative treatment . 
 there were significant reductions in mean total cholesterol ( 58.4% ) , ldl - c ( 71.9% ) , triglycerides ( 51% ) , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol ( 9.3% ) , and non - hdl ( 68.2% ) values . 
 thirty - four cardiac events were documented in 8 patients before apheresis , compared with 9 events in 5 patients after apheresis . 
 our survey showed a high prevalence of statin intolerance ( 64% ) , with the majority ( 90% ) of participants indicating an interest in alternative treatment options . 
 our results have shown that lipid apheresis primary effect is a marked reduction in ldl - c cholesterol levels and may reduce the recurrence of cardiac events . 
 apheresis should be compared to the newer alternative treatment modalities in a randomized fashion due to patient interest in alternative options . "

 serum a levels were measured from 208 subjects who were cognitively normal at enrollment and blood draw . 
 twenty - eight of the subjects subsequently developed mci ( n = 18 ) or ad ( n = 10 ) over the follow - up period . 
 baseline measures of global cognition , memory , language fluency , and serum a142 and the ratio of serum a142/a140 were significant predictors for future mci / ad using cox regression with demographic variables , apoe 4 , vascular risk factors , and specific medication as covariates . an optimal sensitivity of 85.2% and specificity of 86.5% for predicting mci / ad was achieved using roc analyses .

," we compared serum polychlorinated dibenzo - p - dioxins ( pcdds ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( pcdfs ) among residents of two homes to levels among age- and sex - matched comparison subjects . 
 the residents of the two homes consumed contaminated eggs and beef from animals raised at the homes . 
 the animals had greater soil contact than those raised with conventional commercial husbandry practices . 
 the comparison subjects were from a similar rural area , but did not consume home - produced beef and eggs . 
 serum levels of 2,3,7 , 8-substituted tetra- , penta- , and hexacdds and penta- , hexa- , and heptacdfs were increased between 2- and 6-fold in residents from one home ; contaminated eggs and beef were consumed by residents for 2 - 15 years . 
 elevations were less for those in the other index home , where only home - produced eggs were consumed for 2 years ; a 3-fold elevation of 1,2,3,7,8,9-hexacdd as compared to controls was most apparent . 
 very strong bivariate correlations among all of the 2,3,7 , 8 penta- and hexacdds / cdfs were observed . 
 the elevations observed verify that pcdd / pcdf - contaminated food contributed to the body burden of these compounds . 
 the blood levels among the highest exposed participants are generally higher than those observed in other studies of u.s . 
 contaminated - fish consumers and higher than average adipose tissue levels observed in u.s . urban populations . 
 there are sufficient animal toxicologic and human epidemiologic data to recommend that exposures be reduced . in the study area , 
 pentachlorophenol and pentachlorophenol incineration sources have been identified , and the animal contamination and blood elevations probably reflect these sources . 
 soil reference values and site - specific risk assessments should include estimates of exposures to contamination in home - produced animal products . 
 such estimates can be verified with limited pcdd / pcdf sampling of animals and humans.imagesfigure 1figure 2 "
the wntcatenin pathway has been implicated in the development and progression of melanoma and a wide range of cancer types  including colorectal cancer  breast cancer  esophageal carcinoma  and liver cancer  13    however  our results show that the expression levels of catenin do not contribute to melanoma initiation and progression since no difference in catenin levels was found between nevi  primary melanoma  and metastatic melanoma  9397 of all samples expressed catenin in  50 of the tumor cells," we have previously demonstrated that rad6 and -catenin enhance each other 's expression through a positive feedback loop to promote breast cancer development / progression . while -catenin has been implicated in melanoma pathogenesis , rad6 function has not been investigated . here 
 , we examined the relationship between rad6 and -catenin in melanoma development and progression . 
 eighty - eight cutaneous tumors 
 , 30 nevi , 29 primary melanoma , and 29 metastatic melanomas , were immunostained with anti--catenin and anti - rad6 antibodies . strong expression of rad6 was observed in only 27% of nevi as compared to 100% of primary and 96% of metastatic melanomas . 
 -catenin was strongly expressed in 97% of primary and 93% of metastatic melanomas , and unlike rad6 , in 93% of nevi . 
 none of the tumors expressed nuclear -catenin . 
 -catenin was exclusively localized on the cell membrane of 55% of primary , 62% of metastatic melanomas , and only 10% of nevi . 
 cytoplasmic -catenin was detected in 90% of nevi , 17% of primary , and 8% of metastatic melanoma , whereas 28% of primary and 30% of metastatic melanomas exhibited -catenin at both locations . 
 these data suggest that melanoma development and progression are associated with rad6 upregulation and membranous redistribution of -catenin and that -catenin and rad6 play independent roles in melanoma development . "

 the provider offered treatment with guaifenesin 600 mg extended release tablets twice daily . 
 two months after guaifenesin therapy the semen analysis was repeated that demonstrated marked improvement in both total sperm count and motility.conclusionevidence for the effectiveness of guaifenesin is almost entirely anecdotal . 
 given the mechanism of action of guaifenesin , it is not clear from this case why the patient demonstrated such a large improvement in both sperm count and motility . 
 additional studies of the effects of guaifenesin on male fertility could yield information of the medication s effect on men with normal or decreased total sperm counts . "

 arguments for discontinuing lumbar injections have been discussed in the anesthesia literature , raising concern about the risks of epidural steroid injections ( esis).methodsin a 47-year - old man , paraplegia of the lower extremities developed , specifically conus medullaris syndrome , after he underwent an esi for recurrent pain . 
 correct needle placement was verified with epidurography . immediately after the injection , 
 the patient felt his legs  going dead  ; paraplegia of the lower extremities was noted.resultsan initial magnetic resonance imaging study performed after the patient was transferred to the emergency department was unremarkable . 
 however , a later neurosurgical evaluation showed conus medullaris syndrome , and a second magnetic resonance imaging study showed the conus infarct . 
 we conducted a search of the pubmed database of articles from 2002 to 2011 containing the following keywords : complications , lumbar epidural steroid injection(s ) , cauda equina syndrome , conus medullaris infarction , spinal cord infarction , spinal cord injury , paralysis , paresis , plegia , paresthesia , and anesthesia.conclusionssummarizing this case and 5 similar cases , we weigh the potential benefits and risks of esi . although one can safely assume that this severe , devastating complication is rare , we speculate that its true incidence remains unknown , possibly because of medicolegal implications . 
 we believe that the rarity of this complication should not preclude the continued use of transforaminal esi ; rather , it should be emphasized for discussion with patients during the consent process . "
," because of rampant concern that estrogenic chemicals in the environment may be adversely affecting the health of humans and wildlife , reliable methods for detecting and characterizing estrogenic chemicals are needed . 
 it is important that general agreement be reached on which tests to use and that these tests then be applied to the testing of both man - made and naturally occurring chemicals . as a step toward developing a comprehensive approach to screening 
 chemicals for estrogenic activity , three assays for detecting estrogenicity were conducted on 10 chemicals with known or suspected estrogenic activity . 
 the assays were 1 ) competitive binding with the mouse uterine estrogen receptor , 2 ) transcriptional activation in hela cells transfected with plasmids containing an estrogen receptor and a response element , and 3 ) the uterotropic assay in mice . 
 the chemicals studied were 17 beta - estradiol , diethylstilbestrol , tamoxifen , 4-hydroxytamoxifen , methoxychlor , the methoxychlor metabolite 2,2-bis(p - hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane ( hpte ) , endosulfan , nonylphenol , o , p'-ddt , and kepone . 
 these studies were conducted to assess the utility of this three - assay combination in the routine screening of chemicals , or combinations of chemicals , for estrogenic activity . 
 results were consistent among the three assays with respect to what is known about the estrogenic activities of the chemicals tested and their requirements for metabolic activation . by providing information on three levels of hormonal activity 
 ( receptor binding , transcriptional activation , and an in vivo effect in an estrogen - responsive tissue ) , an informative profile of estrogenic activity is obtained with a reasonable investment of resources.imagesp1296-afigure 1.figure 2.figure 3.figure 4.figure 5 . "
"alzheimer s disease  ad  is a neurodegenerative disorder that is clinically characterized by progressive mental decline and histopathologically defined by highly abundant amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain parenchyma  
  in sum  it appears that the preponderance of the data can be most consistently interpreted as showing that the brain inflammatory protein apoe plays a catalytic role in the ad  ds amyloid cascade and consequent cognitive decline  with binding and clearance differences between the apoe isoforms reflecting their differing abilities to bind to a and catalyze its conversion into neurotoxic macromolecular species  figure 2"," the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains a robust model of ad neurodegeneration . 
 however , amyloid deposits contain proteins besides a , such as apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) . 
 inheritance of the apoe4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late - onset ad . 
 however , there is no consensus on how different apoe isotypes contribute to ad pathogenesis . 
 it has been hypothesized that apoe and apoe4 in particular is an amyloid catalyst or  
 pathological chaperone  . 
 alternatively it has been posited that apoe regulates a clearance , with apoe4 been worse at this function compared to apoe3 . 
 these views seem fundamentally opposed . 
 the former would indicate that removing apoe will reduce ad pathology , while the latter suggests increasing brain apoe levels may be beneficial . 
 here we consider the scientific basis of these different models of apoe function and suggest that these seemingly opposing views can be reconciled . the optimal therapeutic target may be to inhibit the interaction of apoe with a rather than altering apoe levels . 
 such an approach will not have detrimental effects on the many beneficial roles apoe plays in neurobiology . 
 furthermore , other a binding proteins , including act and apo j can inhibit or promote a oligomerization / polymerization depending on conditions and might be manipulated to effect ad treatment . "

"small bowel obstruction  sbo  is one of the most feared complications after a gastric bypass  
a hand  sewn technique could be used to close the common enterotomy and might reduce the incidence of sbo slightly  but the cut end of the biliopancreatic limb still has an exposed staple line"," background and objectives : there is a wide variation of reported incidence of small bowel obstruction ( sbo ) after laparoscopic roux - en - y gastric bypass ( lgb ) . 
 there is also wide variation in technique , not only in placement of the roux limb , but also regarding closure or nonclosure of the mesenteric defects . 
 the objective of this study was to examine the incidence and characteristics of sbo after antecolic antegastric bypass with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect of the jejunojejunal anastomosis.methods:this is a retrospective review of a series of consecutive lgbs over a 3-year period . 
 all procedures were performed by the same surgeon using the same technique . in no case was the mesenteric defect closed . a prospectively maintained database 
 was used for data collection . 
 patients who returned with an sbo were the study group , and those who underwent revisional bariatric surgery or conversion to open operation were excluded.results:there were 249 primary lgbs performed during the study period ; 15 of the operations were followed by sbo , for an incidence of 6.0% . 
 four cases were caused by an internal hernia ( ih ) , for an incidence of 1.6% , and 11 were caused by adhesions , which accounted for 73% of the sbos.conclusions:sbo after lgb is a relatively common complication . 
 the incidence of sbo from ih with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect is similar to that in other series where the defect is closed . 
 regardless of the cause of the sbo , operative treatment of the patient who has a gastric bypass remains the definitive standard and should not be delayed . "

"mental fatigue is common and can be a disabling long  time condition following a stroke   even for those with an almost recovered stroke and without neurological and neuropsychological impairments 
the person who suffers from mental fatigue is able to perform mental effort just for short periods  and  notably  it will take longer than normal to regain energy after being exhausted"," mental fatigue is for many a distressing and long - term problem after stroke . 
 this mental fatigue will make it more difficult for the person to return to work and previous activities . 
 the intention with this study is to investigate mental fatigue in relation to depression and cognitive functions . 
 we examined 24 well - rehabilitated stroke subjects , who suffered from mental fatigue one year or more after a stroke , and 24 healthy controls . 
 subjects were examined using self - assessment scales for mental fatigue , depression and anxiety , and cognitive tests . 
 the results showed a highly increased rating for mental fatigue for the stroke group ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 these participants also had a significantly higher rating on the depression ( p < 0.001 ) and anxiety ( p < 0.001 ) scales . 
 furthermore , they had a slower information processing speed ( p < 0.001 ) and made more errors in a demanding attention and speed test ( p < 0.05 ) . among the cognitive tests , processing speed and errors made in an attention and speed test were significant predictors for mental fatigue . 
 we suggest mental fatigue following a stroke to be related to cognitive impairments , primarily information processing speed . 
 mental fatigue should also be treated as a separate phenomenon and should be differentiated from , and not confused with , depression , even if overlapping symptoms exist . "

 there are many toxic compounds in cigarette smoke , including acrolein and other ,-unsaturated aldehydes , which are regarded as mediators of inflammation and vascular dysfunction . 
 furthermore , recent studies have revealed that acrolein , an ,-unsaturated aldehyde in cigarette smoke , induces inflammatory mediator expression , which is known to be related to vascular diseases . in this study , we investigated whether korean red ginseng ( krg ) water extract suppressed acrolein - induced cyclooxygenase ( cox)-2 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) . 
 acrolein - induced cox-2 expression was accompanied by increased levels of phosphorylated p38 in huvecs and krg inhibited cox-2 expression in huvecs . 
 these results suggest that krg suppresses acrolein - induced cox-2 expression via inhibition of the p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase signaling pathway . 
 in addition , krg exhibited an inhibitory effect on acrolein - induced apoptosis , as demonstrated by annexin v

 introduction . 
 low serum vitamin d levels are associated with increased postural sway . 
 vitamin d varies seasonally . 
 this study investigates whether postural sway varies seasonally and is associated with serum vitamin d and falls 
 . methods . in a longitudinal observational study , eighty - eight independently mobile community - dwelling older adults ( 69.7  7.6 years ) were evaluated on five occasions over one year , measuring postural sway ( force platform ) , vitamin d levels , fall incidence , and causes and adverse outcomes . 
 mixed - methods poisson regression was used to determine associations between measures . results . 
 postural sway did not vary over the year . 
 vitamin d levels varied seasonally ( p < 0.001 ) , peaking in summer . 
 incidence of falls ( p = 0.01 ) and injurious falls ( p = 0.02 ) were lower in spring , with the highest fall rate at the end of autumn . 
 postural sway was not related to vitamin d ( p = 0.87 ) or fall rates , but it was associated with fall injuries ( irr 1.59 ( ci 1.14 to 2.24 , p = 0.007 ) .

effect of alkaloids from senna alata leaves on some indices of oestrogenicity in pregnant rats values are expressed as meansd of six independent determinations  test values carrying superscripts different from the control for each parameter in the same row are significantly different  p  0"," backgroundthe abortifacient claim of senna alata ( s. alata ) was scientifically validated recently with alkaloids speculated to be the bioactive agent . 
 this speculation is yet to be substantiated or refuted by scientific evidence . 
 the present study was aimed to investigate the pregnancy terminating effects of the alkaloids from s. alata leaves.methodstwenty four pregnant rats ( 143.991.21 g ) allocated randomly to four groups : a , b , c and d respectively received , 0.5 ml of distilled water , 250 , 500 and 1000 mg / kg body weight of the s. alata extracted alkaloids orally , once daily from day 10 until day 18 post - coitum . 
 the indices of abortifacient were evaluated at the end of the exposure period . 
 the results were analyzed by both the analysis of variance and duncan 's multiple range test and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.resultsthin-layer chromatographic separation produced five spots with rf values of 0.28 , 0.33 , 0.39 , 0.47 and 0.55 which gave positive reaction with meyer 's and wagner 's reagents , respectively . 
 the number of implantation sites and corpora lutea , as well as the concentrations of fsh , lh , progesterone , weight of uterus , uterine/ body weight ratio , glucose and cholesterol decreased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) whereas the resorption index , pre- and post - implantation losses , uterine protein content and alkaline phosphatase activity increased significantly . 
 none of the alkaloid treated animals presented with provoked vaginal opening or bleeding except fetal deaths . 
 the alkaloid decreased the maternal weight gain , as well as feed and water intake.conclusionoverall , the alkaloids from s. alata leaves exhibited anti - implantation , anti - gonadotropic , anti - progesteronic , embryonic resorptive , feto - maternal toxic activities but not complete abortifacient . 
 the alkaloids alone may not be the sole abortifacient bioactive agent in the leaf extract . "

 therefore , we investigated the association between weight control behaviors ( wcb ) and suicide ideation and attempt , focusing on inappropriate weight control measures . 
 we used data from the 2014 korea youth risk behavior web - based survey , representing a total of 35,224 boys and 34,361 girls aged 12 to 18 years . 
 adolescents were classified into groups based on wcb : appropriate wcb , inappropriate wcb , and no wcb . 
 we performed logistic regression models to examine associations between wcb and suicide ideation and attempt , controlling for covariates . 
 both boys and girls with inappropriate wcb were more likely to report suicide ideation and attempt . 
 underweight and normal weight boys with inappropriate wcb were more likely to think or attempt suicide , and underweight girls with inappropriate wcb were also more likely to attempt suicide . among five common wcb combinations , 
 the combination of "" regular exercise , fasting , eating less "" was highly associated with suicide ideation and attempt . 
 we confirmed that inappropriate wcb is associated with suicide ideation and attempt among korean adolescents . 
 given the high incidence rate of suicide among adolescents and the adverse effect of inappropriate wcb , encouraging adolescents to control their weight in healthy ways is imperative . "
in the past 15 years  green fluorescent protein  gfp  has changed from a nearly unknown protein to a commonly used molecular imaging tool in biology  chemistry  genetics  and medicine  58  since some researchers have argued that the presence of tyr203 leads to a decrease in chromophore flexibility  van der waals volume for tyr  141  vs 93  for thr   and others argue that this is not necessarily so32  we have examined the conformational space available to a freely rotating chromophore in yfp  pdb code 1myw  with the phenol of tyr66 in both the protonated and unprotonated forms," green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) and gfp - like fluorescent proteins owe their photophysical properties to an autocatalytically formed intrinsic chromophore . according to quantum mechanical calculations , 
 the excited state of chromophore model systems has significant dihedral freedom , which may lead to fluorescence quenching intersystem crossing . 
 molecular dynamics simulations with freely rotating chromophoric dihedrals were performed on green , yellow , and blue fluorescent proteins in order to model the dihedral freedom available to the chromophore in the excited state . 
 most current theories suggest that a restriction in the rotational freedom of the fluorescent protein chromophore will lead to an increase in fluorescence brightness and/or quantum yield . according to our calculations , the dihedral freedom of the systems studied ( bfp > a5 > yfp > gfp ) increases in the inverse order to the quantum yield . in all simulations , 
 the chromophore undergoes a negatively correlated hula twist ( also known as a bottom hula twist mechanism ) . "

 we determined the role of de novo ceramide synthesis in mediating muscle insulin resistance.research design and methodsmice were subjected to 12 weeks of diet - induced obesity ( dio ) , and then treated for 4 weeks with myriocin , an inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase-1 ( spt1 ) , the rate - limiting enzyme of de novo ceramide synthesis.resultsafter 12 weeks of dio , c57bl/6 mice demonstrated a doubling in gastrocnemius ceramide content , which was completely reversed ( 141.5  15.8 vs. 94.6  10.2 nmol / g dry wt ) via treatment with myriocin , whereas hepatic ceramide content was unaffected by dio . 
 interestingly , myriocin treatment did not alter the dio - associated increase in gastrocnemius diacyglycerol content , and the only correlation observed between lipid metabolite accumulation and glucose intolerance occurred with ceramide ( r = 0.61 ) . 
 dio mice treated with myriocin showed a complete reversal of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance which was associated with enhanced insulin - stimulated akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation . 
 furthermore , myriocin treatment also decreased intramyocellular ceramide content and prevented insulin resistance development in db / db mice . finally , myriocin - treated dio mice displayed enhanced oxygen consumption rates ( 3,041  124 vs. 2,407  124 
 ml / kg / h ) versus their control counterparts.conclusionsour results demonstrate that the intramyocellular accumulation of ceramide correlates strongly with the development of insulin resistance , and suggests that inhibition of spt1 is a potentially promising target for the treatment of insulin resistance .

 therefore , we sought to investigate how middle age impacts skeletal muscle fatty acid handling and to determine how this contributes to the development of diet - induced insulin resistance.research design and methodswhole - body and skeletal muscle insulin resistance were studied in young and middle - aged wild - type and cd36 knockout ( ko ) mice fed either a standard or a high - fat diet for 12 weeks . 
 molecular signaling pathways , intramuscular triglycerides accumulation , and targeted metabolomics of in vivo mitochondrial substrate flux were also analyzed in the skeletal muscle of mice of all ages.resultsmiddle-aged mice fed a standard diet demonstrated an increase in intramuscular triglycerides without a concomitant increase in insulin resistance . 
 however , middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet were more susceptible to the development of insulin resistance  a condition that could be prevented by limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport and excessive lipid accumulation in middle - aged cd36 ko mice.conclusionour data provide insight into the mechanisms by which aging becomes a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance . 
 our data also demonstrate that limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport is an effective approach for delaying the development of age - associated insulin resistance and metabolic disease during exposure to a high - fat diet . "

 we aimed to identify optimal cut - off points of high sensitive c - reactive protein ( hs - crp ) in new - onset dm people based on fpg , 2-hpg , or hba1c methods . 
 data derived from recent population - based survey in turkey ( turdep - ii ) . 
 the study included 26,499 adult people ( 63% women , response rate 85% ) . 
 the mean serum concentration of hs - crp in women was higher than in men ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the people with new - onset dm based on hba1c had higher mean hs - crp level than fpg based and 2-hpg based dm cases . in hba1c , 2-hpg , and 
 fpg based new - onset dm people , cut - off levels of hs - crp in women were 2.9 , 2.1 , and 2.5  mg / l [ 27.5 , 19.7 , and 23.5  nmol / l ] and corresponding values in men were 2.0 , 1.8 , and 1.8  mg / l ( 19.0 , 16.9 , and 16.9  
 nmol / l ) , respectively ( sensitivity 6065% and specificity 5464% ) . 
 our results revealed that hs - crp may not further strengthen the diagnosis of new - onset dm . 
 nevertheless , the highest hs - crp level observed in new - onset dm people diagnosed with hba1c criterion supports the general assumption that this method might recognize people in more advanced diabetic stage compared with other diagnostic methods . "

 radiotherapy and chemotherapy are not painful processes , but children undergoing these procedures must be made motionless through anesthesia or sedation . 
 there are a few reports of complications during these procedures in relation to the procedures themselves or to the anesthesia given . 
 this report describes an unexpected pulseless radial artery which was preliminarily and unduly attributed to anesthesia . 
 a 2.5 year - old male pediatric patient with an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was scheduled for radiotherapy . 
 anesthesia with intramuscular ketamine was induced before starting radiotherapy . 
 about 5 minutes after injection of ketamine we found the right radial pulse undetectable . 
 there was no other manifestation of hypoxia or hypo - perfusion . 
 carotid pulsation was normal . 
 examination of the left radial pulse and other peripheral pulses showed normal pulsation . 
 the procedure was continued uneventfully . 
 the next follow - up after radiotherapy , showed a scar and swelling on the right antecubital area , caused by extravasation of chemotherapeutic agent in the prior period of chemotherapy . 
 doppler ultrasonography of the antecubital vein confirmed the diagnosis . 
 this case study therefore demonstrates that proper intravenous cannula establishment before chemotherapy is of great importance . 
 furthermore , accurate history and physical examination before induction of anesthesia or sedation may be useful in preventing mismanagement in pediatric cancer procedures . "

"the hallmark of autoimmune diseases is the pathologic activity of the immune system of an organism directed against its own cells and tissues  
since the identification of the dfs pattern might be challenging for routine diagnostic laboratories and inaccurate interpretation can have significant consequences  an immunoadsorption protocol to diminish anti  dfs70 antibody reactivity to hep2000 cells could be implemented in the current iif assay in order to significantly improve the performance characteristics of the ana iif test  21  25"," for the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases ( sard ) , patients are screened for anti - nuclear antibodies ( ana ) . 
 ana , as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence ( iif ) , have a poor specificity . 
 this hampers interpretation of positive results in clinical settings with low pretest probability of sard . 
 we hypothesized that the utility of positive ana iif results increases from primary to tertiary care . 
 we retrospectively determined ana , anti - ena , and anti - dsdna antibody prevalence in patient cohorts from primary ( n = 1453 ) , secondary ( n = 1621 ) , and tertiary ( n = 1168 ) care settings . 
 results reveal that from primary care to tertiary care , ana prevalence increases ( 6.2 , 10.8 , and 16.0% , resp . ) . moreover , in primary care low titres ( 70% versus 51% and 52% in secondary and tertiary care , resp . ) 
 are more frequent and anti - ena / dsdna reactivities are less prevalent ( 21% versus 39% in secondary care ) . 
 typically , in tertiary care the prevalence of anti - ena / dsdna reactivities ( 21% ) is lower than expected . from this descriptive study 
 we conclude that positive ana iif results are more prone to false interpretation in clinical settings with low pretest probabilities for sard , as in primary care . whether alternative approaches , 
 that is , immunoadsorption of anti - dfs70 antibodies or implementation of anti - ena screen assays , perform better , needs to be determined . "

"breast cancer is the most common cancer among american women  except for skin cancers  
necrotic cells were found to induce proinflammatory and tissue repair gene synthesis and cause dc maturation in a tlr2dependent manner  as a result of the release of their intracellular contents"," breast cancer remains a major cause of death in women in the developed world . as toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) 
 are widely expressed on tumor cells and play important roles in the initiation and progression of cancer , they may thus serve as important targets and have an effective perspective on breast cancer treatment . 
 expression of tlrs on breast cancer cells and mononuclear inflammatory cells can promote inflammation and cell survival in the tumor microenvironment . 
 inflammation and cancer are related . 
 it is well known that persistent inflammatory conditions can induce cancer formation , due to production of cytokines and chemokines , which play a crucial role in promoting angiogenesis , metastasis , and subversion of adaptive immunity . 
 tlr signaling in tumor cells can mediate tumor cell immune escape and tumor progression , and it is regarded as one of the mechanisms for chronic inflammation in tumorigenesis and progression . 
 this paper delineates the expression of various tlrs in promotion of inflammation and development of mammary tumors . understanding the mechanisms through which tlrs on breast cancer cells and inflammatory cells regulate growth , survival , and metastatic progression can make them potential targets for breast cancer therapy .

"to review the current knowledge about nonpharmacologic approaches in the prevention and early treatment of type 2 diabetes  
the 20year follow  up of the original da qing cohort showed that a lower type 2 diabetes incidence persisted in the lifestyle intervention groups  combined  compared with control participants"," objectiveto review the current knowledge about nonpharmacologic approaches in the prevention and early treatment of type 2 diabetes.research design and methodsthis study reviewed the research reports dealing with nonpharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing type 2 diabetes with early lifestyle interventions.resultsthe results from the randomized controlled trials all show that people with impaired glucose tolerance who received enhanced lifestyle advice had significantly lower ( on average 50% reduced ) incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with those allocated to receive  usual care . 
  individuals who were able to correct their lifestyle habits as recommended for usual healthy life patterns were mostly protected against type 2 diabetes . 
 thus , compelling evidence exists that most of the cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or at least the onset of the disease can be significantly delayed.conclusionsrandomized controlled trials have unequivocally demonstrated that lifestyle management is highly efficient in the prevention and also in the early management of type 2 diabetes . 
 this evidence of lifestyle modification in diabetes prevention is stronger than for most other multifactorial diseases . "
"the function of sensory receptors  nrec  in the movement control  muscle coordination and perception of the space position of temporo  mandibular joint  tmj  is fundamental although the presence of nrec in the tmj is still debated  some authors have reported on the lack of nervous fibers in the articular disk 12  while florid innervation of tmj has been reported in several studies on animal models and in human 3  6 which suggested that 6 the concentration of sensory receptors within tmj is higher in the areas supporting higher strong tensions during articular movements  chewing  biting  speaking   
the results of our study indicate that free nervous endings described by other authors 3  8 are definitely proven to be nrec  and it appears likely to stress that  especially in pathological conditions  chondrocytes and their prolongments might morphologically resemble nrec in the articular disk  although their immunophenotype is rather different with the lack of expression of typical neural antigens"," aim : a study was performed on the articular disk and periarticular tissues of the temporo - mandibular joint ( tmj ) with immunohistochemical techniques to give evidence to the presence of neuroreceptors ( nrec ) in these sites . methods : the study was carried out on tissue samples obtained from 10 subjects without tmj disease and from 7 patients with severe tmj arthritis and arthrosis . 
 we use antibodies directed against following antigens : gliofibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) , leu-7 , myelin basic protein ( mbp ) , neurofilaments 68 kd ( nf ) , neuron specific enolase ( nse ) , s-100 protein ( s-100 ) and synaptophysin ( syn ) . 
 results : this study revealed that ruffini's - like , pacini's - like and golgi's - like receptors can be demonstrated in tmj periarticular tissues and that free nervous endings are present in the subsynovial tissues but not within the articular disk . 
 we observed elongated cytoplamic processes of chondrocytes that demonstrated strong s-100 immunoreactivity but they were unreactive with all other antibodies . 
 these cytoplamic processes were more abundant and thicker in the samples obtained from patients with disease tmj . 
 conclusion : the results of this study confirm that different nrec are detectable in tmj periarticular tissues but they are absent within the articular disk . in the latter site , only condrocytic processes are evident , especially in diseased tmj , and they might have been confused with nervous endings in previous morphological studies . 
 nevertheless the absence of immunoreactivity for nf , nse and syn proves that they are not of neural origin . "

 we should have also considered the natural improvement of cardiac function after the corrective operation  which could be a confounding factor for evaluating the efficacy of milrinone use in this study"," background and objectivesmilrinone is often used in children to treat acute heart failure and prevent low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgery . due to the lack of studies on the long - term milrinone use in children , the objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the current patterns of milrinone use for 3 days in infants and children with heart diseases.subjects and methodswe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients aged < 13 years who received milrinone for 
 3 days from january 2005 to december 2012 . 
 patients ' characteristics including age , sex , height , weight , and body surface area were recorded . 
 the following parameters were analyzed to identify the clinical application of milrinone : initial infusion rate , maintenance continuous infusion rate , total duration of milrinone therapy , and concomitantly infused inotropes . 
 the safety of milrinone was determined based on the occurrence of adverse events such as hypotension , arrhythmia , chest pain , headache , hypokalemia , and thrombocytopenia.resultswe assessed 730 admissions ( 684 patients ) during this period . 
 ventricular septal defects were the most common diagnosis ( 42.4% ) in these patients . 
 milrinone was primarily used after cardiac surgery in 715 admissions ( 97.9% ) . 
 the duration of milrinone treatment varied from 3 to 64.4 days ( 7 days in 149 admissions ) . ejection fraction and fractional shortening of the left 
 ventricle improved in patients receiving milrinone after cardiac surgery . 
 dose reduction of milrinone due to hypotension occurred in only 4 admissions ( 0.5% ) . 
 although diverse arrhythmias occurred in 75 admissions ( 10.3% ) , modification of milrinone infusion to manage arrhythmia occurred in only 3 admissions ( 0.4% ) . 
 multivariate analysis indicated that the development of arrhythmia was not influenced by the pattern of milrinone use.conclusionmilrinone was generally administered for 3 days in children with heart diseases . 
 the use of milrinone for 3 days was effective in preventing low cardiac output after cardiac surgery when combined with other inotropes , suggesting that milrinone could be safely employed in pediatric patients with heart diseases . "
